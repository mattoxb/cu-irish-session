Welcome to our collection of traditional Irish tunes!  These are arranged according to the style that
we play at our session.  At least, most of us.  At least, at the time the tune was typeset.  The main
reason these are here are so newcomers to the session can learn tunes we are likely to play.

Most tunes have a link to a PDF and perhaps a Lilypond (ly) source file.  If a close approximation exists on 
The Session the link might take you there instead.

## Browse by Type

Traditional Irish music includes many different types of tunes, each with its own rhythm and feel:

### [[Hornpipes]]
Hornpipes are played in 4/4 time with a distinctive dotted rhythm. They have a strong, swinging feel.

### [[Reels]]
Reels are fast-paced tunes in 4/4 or 2/4 time. They're the most common type of tune played at sessions.

### [[Jigs]]
Jigs are lively tunes in 6/8 time. Single jigs, double jigs, and slip jigs each have their own character.

### [[Polkas]]
Polkas are energetic tunes in 2/4 time, popular especially in the Sliabh Luachra tradition.

### [[Waltzes]]
Waltzes are slower tunes in 3/4 time, often played for listening or slow dancing.

### [[Airs]]
Slow airs are unmetered melodies, often based on old songs. They showcase the expressive qualities of Irish music.
