These are tunes we're practicing in the Learning Session (a.k.a Slow Session).
To make learning easier we standardize on a specific and often opinionated
setting.

If we simply stole the arrangement from elsewhere (usually [The Session](https://thesession.org)) we hyperlink the name to the original source.
