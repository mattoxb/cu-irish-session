# About the C-U Irish Session

Welcome to the Champaign-Urbana Irish Music Session! We are a community of musicians and music lovers dedicated to learning and playing traditional Irish music together.

## What is an Irish Session?

An Irish music session is an informal gathering where musicians come together to play traditional Irish tunes. Sessions are welcoming to players of all skill levels, from beginners to experienced musicians.
